    "text1": "Comprehensive data on weather, climate and air quality in cities are unfortunately still available to a limited extent. Within the framework of the BMBF programme Module B we will therefore process already available data and collect new or missing data by means of long-term measurements, intensive measurement campaigns and physical modelling. In order to support the exchange of observation and model data between the project partners beyond the module boundaries to Module A and C, e.g. for the validation of the newly developed urban climate model PALM-4U or for urban climatological and scientific studies, this data management system (DMS) was developed within the research programme.\n If you have and account you can upload data that meets the requirements, via the respective page. If not logged in, you can see and download data that is published under open licences. Please refer to the data standard and data policy, linked above, for more information.",
    "text2": "The use of a uniform data format as well as binding conventions for the use of data and metadata is an essential prerequisite for their effective and efficient administration in the DMS. In addition, a uniform data standard also enables the development and provision of innovative tools for the analysis and visualization of complex and very heterogeneous data. After completion of the programme, data will be made available to the public under the [UC]² Research Licence and the [UC]² Open Licence.",
